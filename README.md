# Hypnos

Hypnos is a parametric geometry engine to create meshes for structures involved in the analysis of breeder blankets.
Code blocks and paths are relative to the root directory.

## Dependencies
+ [Coreform cubit](https://coreform.com/products/downloads/) (2024.3+), along with a working license
+ [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.10+)
+ The numpy python library: `pip install numpy`

This code should be run with Coreform Cubit 2024.3+. The DAGMC workflow will not work in previous versions.
The cubit python library must be accessible by python. On linux,
`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path-to-cubit/bin`

## Installation
Install Hypnos using pip (in hypnos/, the root directory)
`pip install .`
If using as a developer, install as an editable
`pip install --editable .`

## Docs
For the full instructions you will need to build the documentation via sphinx.
```
pip install sphinx
sphinx-build -M html docs/source docs/build
```
You will then be able to access the documentation by opening docs/build/html/index.html in your preferred browser.
Please ensure you don't have an older version of sphinx-build in your path. You can do this by running:
```
which sphinx-build
```

## Usage
Hypnos uses json files to describe parameters of a component.
Components are represented by json objects "{ }", using the "class" key to select a specific component type.
Json files containing a json object describing a component (ex. hcpb_pin.json) can be used where such a json object is expected by using a string with the file name (ex. {"class": "blanket" ... "components" : \["hpcb_pin.json"]})

Examples are given in sample json files

To use hypnos, run main.py, passing the name of the json file to a -f flag (default: examples/sample_pin.json):
```python main.py -f examples/sample_pin.json```

The following flags are also available:
+ -h: Print available flags for use
+ -c: Name of config file to use (optional)
+ -o: Name of geometry file to export including path (default: geometry)
+ -d: Destination to create output file(s) (default: ./)
+ -i: Name of class to print default template for. Leaving empty prints the available templates.
+ -g : Names of formats to export geometry to (defaults to cubit if neither geometry nor mesh options provided anywhere)
+ -m : Names of formats to export mesh to (optional)

The names given to flags -f, -o, and -d will be preferred over their equivalent options in the config file (file, root name, destination)
